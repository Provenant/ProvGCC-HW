# PhobGCC-HW
Seperate repository for the hardware used in the PhobGCC

The main goal of this modification of the PhobGCC PCB design is to improve modularity of components on the Teensy version.

Additional footprints for JST PA connectors will be added to the main motherboard for the C stick, L and R trigger pads, rumble motor, and connector cable.  An additional footprint for a four pin JST PA connector will be added to the C stick daughterboard as well.
